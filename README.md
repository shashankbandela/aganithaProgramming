Written in python3 

Takes the file name as input containing the paragraph as command line argument.

eg: python3 main.py doc.txt

Outputs the converted paragraph to a text file. ('converted' concatenated to the original file name)

eg: doc-converted.txt


All the conversits are stored in lib.txt files 
	eg: curreny formats in 'currency-lib.txt'

NOTE : the current implementation only converts amount to written format
	eg: "dollars 2" to "2$"
